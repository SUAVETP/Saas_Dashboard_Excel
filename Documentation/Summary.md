# Project Summary – SaaS Metrics & Revenue Dashboard

This project presents a comprehensive Excel-based dashboard built to monitor key metrics for a B2B SaaS startup. As a junior data analyst at the company, my task was to transform raw customer and revenue data into a clear, actionable report for stakeholders. The dashboard provides real-time visibility into revenue performance, customer behavior, churn patterns, and plan-level trends.

The goal of this dashboard is to support leadership in making informed decisions around customer retention, pricing strategy, and growth opportunities. By consolidating the most critical SaaS metrics—including MRR, churn rate, LTV, and NPS—this report enables the business team to track performance, identify risks, and prioritize strategic initiatives.

All visuals and calculations were created directly in Excel using pivot tables, , custom formulas, and data cleaning steps. The dashboard design emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and insight-driven storytelling.
