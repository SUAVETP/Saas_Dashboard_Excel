\# Project Background



This project is based on a realistic scenario at a mid-sized B2B SaaS company offering subscription-based software services across different industries and regions.



As a junior data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing customer and revenue data to help the company understand performance trends, identify churn risks, and support decision-making across the business team. The data included customer signup and cancellation dates, subscription plan types, revenue metrics, acquisition channels, NPS scores, and churn reasons.



The company leadership requested a clear, easy-to-read Excel dashboard to answer key business questions, such as:

\- How is our Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) trending?

\- What is our churn rate, and whatâ€™s driving it?

\- Which subscription plans are growing or losing customers?

\- How does customer lifetime value (LTV) compare across plans?

\- Are referral or organic channels more effective for retention?

\- What reasons are customers giving when they churn?

\- Are we improving or declining in customer satisfaction (NPS)?



The analysis and dashboard were created fully in Microsoft Excel to ensure accessibility for non-technical stakeholders. The final result helps the company track SaaS health metrics and make informed decisions around retention, pricing, and customer success.
