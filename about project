# SaaS Metrics & Customer Churn Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project simulates the work of a junior data analyst at a B2B SaaS company. The Excel dashboard was designed to help the company’s leadership monitor key business metrics, spot churn trends, and identify opportunities to improve customer retention and revenue performance.

### 📌 Project Goal

To create a simple, clear, and visually intuitive Excel dashboard that tracks:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Churn rate and reasons
- Customer acquisition trends
- LTV by plan
- NPS scores
- Active customer count

---

### 🧠 Key Insights

- **Overall churn rate** is **36.3%**, with churn volume steadily increasing month over month.
- **Enterprise customers** have the highest lifetime value ($1,528) and lowest churn.
- **Top churn reasons** include *Pricing* and *Switched to Competitor* — suggesting potential gaps in positioning or product value.
- NPS is low overall (5.1), with limited feedback from churned users — indicating a need to capture more feedback before users exit.
- Acquisition grew to **2,000 customers** in 2024 YTD, with 1,274 currently active.
